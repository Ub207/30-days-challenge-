## Part A: Theory Questions

### 1. The AI-Native Developer
An **AI-Native Developer** is a new breed of software engineer who builds applications with AI as a core, foundational component, not just an add-on.
*   **Mindset Shift:** They move from "writing code" to "orchestrating intelligence."
*   **Spec-Driven:** They focus on writing clear specifications (in Markdown) that AI agents use to generate code.
*   **Collaboration:** They treat AI agents as partners, delegating implementation details while focusing on architecture, logic, and evaluation (EvDD).

### 2. M-Shaped Developer vs. T-Shaped Developer
*   **T-Shaped Developer:** Has deep expertise in *one* area (the vertical bar) and broad knowledge across many others (the horizontal bar). This was the standard for Agile teams.
*   **M-Shaped Developer:** Has deep expertise in *multiple* (3 or more) distinct areas (the vertical legs of the 'M') combined with broad lateral knowledge.
    *   **Advantage:** In the AI era, tools allow us to learn faster. An M-Shaped developer can bridge gaps between domains (e.g., Frontend + AI + Cloud), making them highly versatile and valuable for building complete, complex systems independently.

### 3. Composable Vertical Skills
This concept refers to acquiring deep, specialized skills in modular "blocks" that can be stacked or combined.
*   **Vertical:** Deep mastery in a specific niche (e.g., "Vector Databases" or "Next.js").
*   **Composable:** The ability to combine these deep skills to create unique value propositions. For example, combining "Legal Knowledge" + "LLM Engineering" creates a unique profile for building Legal AI tools.

### 4. Importance of Lifelong Learning
For an M-Shaped developer, lifelong learning is survival. The "legs" of the 'M' are not static; technology evolves rapidly. To maintain multiple areas of expertise and add new ones, a developer must constantly learn, unlearn, and relearn, using AI itself as a tutor to accelerate the process.
